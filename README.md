# Cebula-Alert
Welcome to Cebula Alert, a simple 2d clicker game!
This repository was created to improve collaboration and code exchange between cretors.

## About the Game:
Cebula Alert ("cebula" means "onion" in Polish, also the name of people who are fanaticaly hunting for sales) is a simple clicker game, made for Android devices. The goal is to earn as much money as possible. To do that, player has to buy and sell items.
### But sell price is lower than a buy one!
Sometimes, the crowd of 'onions' are smaller than usual and price can be increased. Wait for that time, then sell your inventory and get a huge profit!

## I wanna play!
Please consider that the game is still in heavy development stage and a lot of things are not ready or can be bugged.  
If you still want to try it, feel free to visit [releases](github.com/okgPL/Cebula-Alert/releases/latest) page, where we are publishing not only latest releases, but also development builds (which are very unstable).

## I've found a bug!
Tell us about it at [issues](https://github.com/okgPL/Cebula-Alert/issues) page. We'll reply as soon as possible.
